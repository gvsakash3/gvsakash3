#### [Cycle Consistent Style Transfer (Cycle-GAN VC2)](https://github.com/gvsakash/cycle-gan/): 
* Deployed Cycle-GAN with modified convolution layers, loss functions using PyTorch upon Kubeflow. Scaled to Linux-based DL AMI on AWS and achieved improved resolution and de-hazing.
* Designed a version harnessing lesser compute power. Submitted a test version of TF.js upon Swift and proposed suggested directions & publication ideas.
* Explored VC2 applications, for parallel voice conversions and studied fine-tuning of layers. Presented white paper to Prof. Liu and two seminar sessions. 
* **Keywords** (GANs, CNN, Pytorch, Kubeflow, AWS AMI, CUDA, Docker). Final Report: **[*here*](https://github.com/gvsakash/cycle-gan/blob/master/files/cyc-gan.pdf)**
